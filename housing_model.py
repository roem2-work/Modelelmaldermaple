UW HFS Housing Structural Risk Model (Index-Based, Outcome Neutral)
v4.3 - Capacity Cost Fix

Changes in v4.3:
- CRITICAL FIX: Capacity changes now affect costs and debt, not just revenue cap
  * Adding beds increases operating costs (building maintenance, utilities, staff)
  * Adding beds increases debt service (construction bonds)
  * Revenue only increases if students actually fill the beds
  * This models the "build it and they may not come" risk correctly
- CHART FIX: Capacity_Index now indexed to base CAPACITY, not base HEADCOUNT
  * Old: showed 109 even with no bed changes (confusing)
  * New: shows 100 when no beds added, >100 when beds added
  * Also fixes hidden bug where baseline had 14% debt penalty for spare capacity
- Added capacity cost sensitivity sliders in Advanced section
- New export columns: Expense_Cap_Factor, Debt_Cap_Factor

Changes in v4.2 (Code Review Implementation):
- Extracted demand index calculation into dedicated function for clarity and testability
- Added comprehensive inline comments for traceability
- Reduced executive jargon in labels and tooltips
- Added plain-English interpretation callouts for KPI cards
- Improved scenario descriptions with "when to use" guidance
- Enhanced type hints for numerical safety functions
- Fixed Custom scenario reset button UX with clearer tooltip
- Documented magic numbers and index normalization logic
- Added colorblind-friendly considerations to chart annotations

Previous fixes (v4.1):
- Charts collapsing under scenarios with a debt-peak band was caused by the
  peak-band layer not sharing the same explicit x-scale domain as the rest of the chart.
- Added "UW Enrollment Trend (Class Size)" slider.

Constraints:
- No absolute dollars are computed, displayed, or exported.
- DSCR approximation logic and index mechanics are retained.
- Outcome neutrality: Baseline remains non-alarmist, flat debt timing.

**What is a bond covenant?**
A covenant is a promise in the bond agreement. For HFS, the key covenant requires us to maintain
adequate **coverage** for our debt payments.

**What is "coverage" (DSCR)?**
DSCR stands for **Debt Service Coverage Ratio**. Think of it as:
> "For every dollar we owe in debt payments, how many dollars do we have available?"

The bond requires us to keep this ratio above **{required_dscr:.2f}** (meaning we have ${required_dscr:.2f}
available for every $1.00 we owe).

**Why do we need a safety buffer?**
Because our income depends on enrollment, pricing, and costs, all of which can change. If coverage
drops below the minimum, it's a "covenant breach" which triggers remediation requirements.

**About the numbers in this model:**
All values are shown as **indices** (2025 = 100) rather than dollar amounts. This focuses attention
on trends and structural relationships rather than specific budget numbers.

**Quick Start:**
1. Start with **Baseline** (should show healthy operations with no crisis)
2. Try **Structural Squeeze** to see cost pressure effects
3. Use **Bond Stress Test** to see what a breach scenario looks like

**Key Indicators:**
- **Coverage Ratio**: Above {:.2f} = meeting requirement
- **Safety Cushion**: Above 0 = meeting requirement, below 0 = breach

**Tips:**
- Use the "Focus Year" slider to examine specific planning horizons
- Click "Jump to worst year" to find the most vulnerable point
- The "Assumptions at a Glance" expander shows your current settings
